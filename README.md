# Be One, Be Different (Pool-Service-Website)

A Paid Commission Site for a friend. A basic but necessary first steps for launching a service business. Our website is for a pool service company in one of Central Florida's most sought out vacation destination

## Introduction - The Seemigly Opposite Venture

In efforts, to create the production of a website that may be used as a template design for service based companies such as a pool construction business website. The purpose of this template is to make a service based website be able to do 'seperation of concerns' in seperating the kinds of services they offer on their website and the ability to seperate those services futher. For example, into the 'Work' they do and/or 'Materials' they use during the servicing. To keep consistent interaction and layout through out the pages is vital in ensuring the user does not get confused in the traversing of the site as older and less technology savy users may be the ones interacting with the site.

The reason I created this is to challenge myself to create a simple but effective website design that is uniquely different from the typical mold of websites commonly seen on the market. Making it familiar but unique, a seemingly opposite venture, but a valuable undertaking.

## Technologies - The Very Basics

The project is created with:

- HTML
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Firebase
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

In summary:
I used the very basic technologies, the backbones of the web, HTML, CSS, Javascript. I used only one library good ol' jQuery for some event handling. The most advance of the technologies are my use of CSS Grid, more specifically grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns, my first time using it in production. I also used flexbox and Firebase for contact form back-end handeling.
